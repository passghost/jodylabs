# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a new type of powerup called "Weapon Upgrade Station" that requires players to stand near it for 2 seconds to permanently upgrade their weapon. The powerup provides visual feedback through a filling circle animation to indicate progress, creating a strategic risk-reward mechanic where players must expose themselves to danger to gain permanent weapon improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see weapon upgrade stations spawn in the game world, so that I can identify opportunities to permanently improve my weapons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a weapon upgrade station spawns THEN the system SHALL display a distinctive circular powerup with a unique visual design
2. WHEN a weapon upgrade station is active THEN the system SHALL render it with a different symbol and color scheme than regular powerups
3. WHEN a weapon upgrade station spawns THEN the system SHALL place it randomly on the battlefield like other powerups
4. WHEN a weapon upgrade station is present THEN the system SHALL make it visually distinct with special effects or animations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to activate weapon upgrade stations by standing near them for 2 seconds, so that I can permanently improve my weapon through strategic positioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player moves within activation range of a weapon upgrade station THEN the system SHALL begin the 2-second activation timer
2. WHEN a player moves outside activation range during the timer THEN the system SHALL reset the activation progress
3. WHEN the 2-second timer completes THEN the system SHALL permanently upgrade the player's weapon
4. WHEN the upgrade is complete THEN the system SHALL remove the weapon upgrade station from the battlefield
5. WHEN multiple players are near the station THEN the system SHALL allow both players to benefit from the upgrade

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see visual feedback showing my progress toward activating the weapon upgrade station, so that I know how long I need to remain in position.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player enters activation range THEN the system SHALL display a progress circle that fills over 2 seconds
2. WHEN the progress circle is filling THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate the fill from 0% to 100%
3. WHEN a player leaves activation range THEN the system SHALL immediately hide the progress circle
4. WHEN the progress reaches 100% THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of successful activation
5. WHEN the progress circle is active THEN the system SHALL use contrasting colors to ensure visibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want my weapon to be permanently upgraded when I successfully activate a weapon upgrade station, so that I gain lasting combat advantages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a weapon upgrade is applied THEN the system SHALL increase the player's weapon damage permanently
2. WHEN a weapon upgrade is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the upgrade through level transitions
3. WHEN a weapon upgrade is applied THEN the system SHALL stack with temporary weapon powerups
4. WHEN a weapon upgrade is applied THEN the system SHALL display a notification message to the player
5. WHEN a weapon upgrade is applied THEN the system SHALL persist the upgrade until game restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want weapon upgrade stations to spawn at appropriate frequencies and locations, so that they provide meaningful strategic opportunities without being overpowered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining powerup spawns THEN the system SHALL include weapon upgrade stations with balanced rarity
2. WHEN a weapon upgrade station spawns THEN the system SHALL ensure it appears in accessible locations
3. WHEN multiple weapon upgrade stations exist THEN the system SHALL limit the maximum number active simultaneously
4. WHEN a player has already upgraded significantly THEN the system SHALL adjust spawn rates to maintain game balance
5. WHEN spawning weapon upgrade stations THEN the system SHALL consider the current game difficulty level
